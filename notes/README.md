I went to the 2024 W&B Fully Connected Conference in SF and compiled some notes with slide photos. 

The most common themes were:
- RAG
- Fine tuning
- Year of Productionalization
- Evaluation (not a theme per se, but simply a must)

Some of the highlights:
- Two Minute Papers Author Károly Zsolnai-Fehér presentation: Thought provoking topic about how language as we know is not optimal and how machines have their own, more efficient 'language'.
- Closing Keynote: We are headed towards IQaaS (Intelligence-as-a-service)
